        <h1>GenmoeSyn</h1>
        <p>The progress of new generation sequencing technology promotes the development of comparative genomes based on whole genome sequencing, and synteny analysis of genomes among multiple species is an essential content of comparative genomics. The construction and visualization of synteny blocks require amounts of time and computational resources in addition to advanced bioinformatics skills, and the functions of existing tools and visualization methods cannot meet the growing needs of biologists. To address these limitations, we proposed GenomeSyn, a powerful visualization software for synteny analysis of genomes. GenomeSyn is an easy-to-use application, users only need to submit genomic data for three species, and GenomeSyn will be processed automaticallyï¼Œthe whole process from sequence alignment to synteny analysis of the genome can be realized. GenomeSyn is not only simple to operate and user-friendly, but also meets the growing demand of biologists for genomic analysis.</p>
